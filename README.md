Hello!

My name is Brandon Diaz -- I am a Masters's Student at Pace University (NYC), enrolled in the quantitative analysis program. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few research projects --
  - My personal 'passion' project is an empirical analysis of success in baseball in relation to payroll size and advanced analytics.

  - I am also researching human capital dynamics in Ukraine, with a focus on post-war reconstruction. At the intersection of the UN's Sustainable Development 
    Goals (SDGs) and a country's responsibility to adhere to these goals lie harsh and nuanced realities -- This project aims to address questions like;
    How does a country like Ukraine focus on immediate needs re: recovery whilst doing so in a sustainable manner? Is 'Building Back Greener' an appropriate goal 
    under these conditions?

  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use R and Python in a more applied setting.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: brandondiazofficial@gmail.com  ---- bd75362n@pace.edu

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to run! This year will (hopefully) conclude with 2 half-marathons, with the goal of running the NYC marathon in 2025.
